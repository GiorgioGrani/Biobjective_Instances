# Biobjective_Instances


This library contains instances for biobjective pure integer problems:

* **linear_integer.zip** contains biobjective integer linear instances in **.lp** format. 
   The first constraint is the second objective.
   The name of each file is in the format *added_instance_p-2_n-X_m-Y.lp* where *X* is the number of integer variables and *Y* is the number of constraints.

*  **quadratic_integer.zip** contains biobjective integer linearly constrained quadratic instances in **.lp** format. 
   The first constraint is the second objective.
   The name of each file is in the format *QuadraticILP_p-Z_n-X_m-Y.lp* where *X* is the number of integer variables, *Y* is the number of constraints. *Z* has not to be taken into consideration since it is inherited from [moolibrary](http://home.ku.edu.tr/~moolibrary/).
